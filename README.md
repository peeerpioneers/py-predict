Modularity (Functions): The code is broken down into well-defined functions: load_data, preprocess_data, build_lstm_model, prepare_test_data, and plot_predictions. This makes the code:

More readable: Easier to understand the purpose of each part.

Reusable: You can easily reuse these functions in other projects.

Testable: You can write unit tests for each function independently.

Maintainable: Easier to modify and debug.

Constants: Important values like COMPANY, TRAIN_START, TRAIN_END, PREDICTION_DAYS, EPOCHS, BATCH_SIZE are defined as constants at the top. This makes the code easier to configure and avoids "magic numbers" scattered throughout.

if __name__ == "__main__": block: This is standard Python practice. It ensures that the main execution code (loading data, training the model, etc.) only runs when the script is executed directly (not when it's imported as a module).

Data Loading: The load_data function encapsulates the data loading using yfinance.

Data Preprocessing:

The preprocess_data function handles scaling and creating the training sequences.

The scaler is fit and transformed on the training data only, as it should be.

Clear test/train split: TEST_START is set after TRAIN_END to prevent data leakage.

Model Building: The build_lstm_model function creates and compiles the LSTM model. This makes it easy to experiment with different model architectures.

Training:

The code now includes EarlyStopping, which is a crucial technique. It stops training when the model's performance on a validation set stops improving, preventing overfitting and saving time. You don't have to guess the number of epochs.

The verbose parameter in model.fit controls how much information is printed during training.

Prepare test data:

The function prepare_test_data correctly handles all steps for test preparation

Uses training scaler.

Prediction: The prediction code is now more concise and uses the functions defined above.

Plotting: The plot_predictions function handles the visualization of the results.

Single Future Prediction: The code includes a section for making a single future prediction, which is often the ultimate goal of a time series model. It correctly prepares the input data using the last PREDICTION_DAYS of scaled data.

Comments: The code is thoroughly commented, explaining each step and the reasoning behind the changes.

No Redundant Model Compilation/Training: The original code had model.compile and model.fit called twice. This has been corrected.
